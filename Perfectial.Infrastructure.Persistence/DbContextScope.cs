                     * the ambient context before creating the task - that way we wouldn't have captured

                     * While this is definitely a programming error, it's not worth throwing here. We can only 
                     * be in one of two scenario:
                     * 
                     * - If the developer who created the parallel task was mindful to force the creation of 
                     * a new scope in the parallel task (with IDbContextScopeFactory.CreateNew() instead of 
                     * JoinOrCreate()) then no harm has been done. We haven't tried to access the same DbContext
                     * instance from multiple threads.
                     * 
                     * - If this was not the case, they probably already got an exception complaining about the same
                     * DbContext or ObjectContext being accessed from multiple threads simultaneously (or a related
                     * error like multiple active result sets on a DataReader, which is caused by attempting to execute
                     * several queries in parallel on the same DbContext instance). So the code has already blow up.
                     *

                    var message = @"PROGRAMMING ERROR - When attempting to dispose a DbContextScope, we found that our parent DbContextScope has already been disposed! This means that someone started a parallel flow of execution (e.g. created a TPL task, created a thread or enqueued a work item on the ThreadPool) within the context of a DbContextScope without suppressing the ambient context first. 

                    In order to fix this:
                    1) Look at the stack trace below - this is the stack trace of the parallel task in question.
                    2) Find out where this parallel task was created.
                    3) Change the code so that the ambient context is suppressed before the parallel task is created. You can do this with IDbContextScopeFactory.SuppressAmbientContext() (wrap the parallel task creation code block in this).

        /*
         * This is where all the magic happens. And there is not much of it.
         * 
         * This implementation is inspired by the source code of the
         * TransactionScope class in .NET 4.5.1 (the TransactionScope class
         * is prior versions of the .NET Fx didn't have support for async
         * operations).
         * 
         * In order to understand this, you'll need to be familiar with the
         * concept of async points. You'll also need to be familiar with the
         * ExecutionContext and CallContext and understand how and why they 
         * flow through async points. Stephen Toub has written an
         * excellent blog post about this - it's a highly recommended read:
         * http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/06/15/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext.aspx
         * 
         * Overview: 
         * 
         * We want our DbContextScope instances to be ambient within 
         * the context of a logical flow of execution. This flow may be 
         * synchronous or it may be asynchronous.
         * 
         * If we only wanted to support the synchronous flow scenario, 
         * we could just store our DbContextScope instances in a ThreadStatic 
         * variable. That's the "traditional" (i.e. pre-async) way of implementing
         * an ambient context in .NET. You can see an example implementation of 
         * a TheadStatic-based ambient DbContext here: http://coding.abel.nu/2012/10/make-the-dbcontext-ambient-with-unitofworkscope/ 
         * 
         * But that would be hugely limiting as it would prevent us from being
         * able to use the new async features added to Entity Framework
         * in EF6 and .NET 4.5.
         * 
         * So we need a storage place for our DbContextScope instances 
         * that can flow through async points so that the ambient context is still 
         * available after an await (or any other async point). And this is exactly 
         * what CallContext is for.
         * 
         * There are however two issues with storing our DbContextScope instances 
         * in the CallContext:
         * 
         * 1) Items stored in the CallContext should be serializable. That's because
         * the CallContext flows not just through async points but also through app domain 
         * boundaries. I.e. if you make a remoting call into another app domain, the
         * CallContext will flow through this call (which will require all the values it
         * stores to get serialized) and get restored in the other app domain.
         * 
         * In our case, our DbContextScope instances aren't serializable. And in any case,
         * we most definitely don't want them to be flown accross app domains. So we'll
         * use the trick used by the TransactionScope class to work around this issue.
         * Instead of storing our DbContextScope instances themselves in the CallContext,
         * we'll just generate a unique key for each instance and only store that key in 
         * the CallContext. We'll then store the actual DbContextScope instances in a static
         * Dictionary against their key. 
         * 
         * That way, if an app domain boundary is crossed, the keys will be flown accross
         * but not the DbContextScope instances since a static variable is stored at the 
         * app domain level. The code executing in the other app domain won't see the ambient
         * DbContextScope created in the first app domain and will therefore be able to create
         * their own ambient DbContextScope if necessary.
         * 
         * 2) The CallContext is flow through *all* async points. This means that if someone
         * decides to create multiple threads within the scope of a DbContextScope, our ambient scope
         * will flow through all the threads. Which means that all the threads will see that single 
         * DbContextScope instance as being their ambient DbContext. So clients need to be 
         * careful to always suppress the ambient context before kicking off a parallel operation
         * to avoid our DbContext instances from being accessed from multiple threads.
