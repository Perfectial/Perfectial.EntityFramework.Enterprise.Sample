    /// (and optionally starts an explicit database transaction).
    /// - Keeps track of the DbContext instances it created so that it can return the existing
    /// instance when asked for a DbContext of a specific type.
    /// - Takes care of committing / rolling back changes and transactions on all the DbContext
    /// instances it created when its Commit() or Rollback() method is called.
